# Skyrim Save Manager

Beth and I want to play Skyrim together so bad but also want to easily manage our saves. The 'characters' menu in the special edition didn't work for us so I made this little Node.js script to manage them our saves for us.

### Setup:

1. clone
2. `npm i`

Create a batch script like this:

```
cd "Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition"
node repos/skyrimSaves/index.js
```
