# Skyrim Save Manager

Beth and I want to play Skyrim together so bad, but want to easily manage our saves. The 'characters' menu in the special edition didn't work for us so I made this  Node.js script to manage our saves automatically.

### Setup:

1. Disable cloud updates on Skyrim.
   * it doesn't like the files changing at all
2. clone
3. `npm i`
4. Create a batch script like this:

```
node "...\Documents\GitHub\skyrimSaves\index.js" "...\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition"
```

5. Launch batch script instead of launching Skyrim SE from Steam.
